I'll be the first to admit that the intersection between the sets of people that prefer terminal UI (TUI) apps and use Linear.app for issue tracking is tiny. It has at least a population of 1 - me.

Finding product market fit should be a walk in the park, so I wrote a \[TUI client called lt]\(https\://github.com/markmarkoh/lt).
