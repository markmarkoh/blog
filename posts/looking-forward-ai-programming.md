The Windsurf series of events last week was bizarre, but not surprising. I predict the next few years of AI-assisted software tooling will be crazy with a lot of product switching. Cursor’s dominance is not here to stay, for 3 reasons:

1. Developers rarely have loyalty to software that have to we pay for
2. Switching costs for these products are at an all-time-low
3. Venture Capital subsidies that we-the-consumer benefit from will end for one company as they start for another

We are currently beneficiaries of a classic VC-backed startup strategy - subsidize end-user costs with Venture Capital to gain market dominance and improve unit economics once enough market share is captured.

I just don’t think that strategy will work with extremely low switching costs and zero loyalty.

Cursor will clamp down usage and raise costs, and another vendor with a similar value-add will swoop in with a cool $40 million Series A check.
