The next few years of LLM-assisted software engineering will involve switching from product to product. Cursor’s current dominance is temporary, for three reasons:

* Developers rarely have loyalty to software that we pay for
* Switching costs for these products are at an all-time-low
* VC subsidies that we all benefit from will end for one company as they start for another

### Loyalty

The only loyalty I’ll admit to having is for Neovim, a free and open-source code editor.

I use a Mac because it is the best-in-class hardware and software duo, but show me a Linux distro and laptop combo that are as easy to use and cheaper, and this Mac turns into a hand-me-down immediately, but I have no loyalty to Apple, or virtually anything else I pay for - including Notion, Linear, Figma, TablePlus, etc.

Developers rarely have loyalty to software that we need to pay to use.

### Switching Costs

In the span of a single day I've used v0, Cursor, Copilot (through Neovim), ChatGPT, and Claude Code, without breaking a sweat. I’ve already switched from v0 to bolt.new, and ChatGPT to Claude Chat. I'll pick the right tool for the job.

When another product pops up and gains popularity, I’ll switch immediately. It is virtually free to switch between these products. Keybindings & color themes may be the only cost we have to pay, and most tools ship with world-class keybinding & color theme settings.

Alternatively, switching a project from Typescript to Rust, or re-platforming from AWS to Azure, or migrating the sales team from Hubspot to Salesforce - each of these have significant prohibitive switching costs.

Developers are also hyper-conscious of vendor lock-in, and we either avoid it or make sure there is an eject-path.

### VC Subsidies

We are currently all beneficiaries of a classic VC-backed startup strategy - subsidize end-user costs with Venture Capital to gain market dominance, improve unit economics once enough market share is captured, and be patient until a liquidity event for the founders.

This isn’t a new strategy, nor a controversial one. Consumers benefited from Uber in their early days, where costs were so low for a ride that it made alternative forms of transportation unfathomable. DoorDash fees were low or non-existent early on that it always made sense to “dash” it. Costs are higher now - more considerations are made before using these services.

Currently Cursor, v0, and all of the major LLM providers like Anthropic and OpenAI are dirt cheap. The ongoing costs of building and powering data centers, high salaries for AI engineers, and costs for training new models will rise. Eventually the investors will expect returns and the consumers will pick up the bill.

**This strategy is sane if it weren’t for the lack of loyalty and the low switching costs.**

Once the Cursor prices rise, another Cursor competitor will have fresh VC cash, and we’ll switch en-masse.

Copying the segment of the podcast Acquired, here are my bear and bull arguments for LLM tech for software engineering:

**Bull**

LLM providers go vertical, and provide not just the LLM, but the entirety of the coding tool stack.

OpenAI purchasing Windsurf makes perfect sense, even though it fell through. Going vertical is the right move. Anthropic building Claude Code makes sense.

**Bear**

Developers already feel worn out and overwhelmed by the LLM wave. Developers with deep experience have found a lot of good uses for LLMs, but also we see the limitations.

Most of the LLM hype-train is conducted by less technical people trying their hand at being an influencer, or by investors/founders with something to gain if their hot-takes are right. Ask the people with less to gain, and you’ll hear a much more subdued take on LLMs.
