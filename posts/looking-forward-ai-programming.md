The next few years of LLM-assisted software engineering will involve switching from product to product. Cursor’s current dominance is temporary, for three reasons:

* Developers rarely have loyalty to software that have to we pay for
* Switching costs for these products are at an all-time-low
* VC subsidies that we-the-consumer benefit from will end for one company as they start for another

### Loyalty

The only loyalty I’ll admit to having is for Neovim, a free and open-source code editor.

I use a Mac because it is the best-in-class hardware and software duo, but show me a Linux distro and laptop combo that are as easy to use and cheaper, and this Mac turns into a hand-me-down immediately, but I have no loyalty to Apple, or virtually anything else I pay for - including Notion, Linear, Figma, TablePlus, etc.

### Switching Costs

I’ve used v0, Cursor, Copilot (through Neovim), ChatGPT, and Claude Code in a single day in 2025, without breaking a sweat. I’ve already switched from v0 to bolt.new, and ChatGPT to Claude Chat. I pick the right tool for the job.

When another tool pops up or gains popularity, I’ll switch immediately. It is virtually free to switch between these tools. Keybindings & color themes may be the only cost we have to pay, and most tools ship with world-class keybinding & color theme settings.

Alternatively, switching a project from Typescript to Rust, or replatforming from AWS to Azure, or migrating the sales team from Hubspot to Salesforce - each of these have significant prohibitive switching costs.

### VC Subsidies

We are currently all beneficiaries of a classic VC-backed startup strategy - subsidize end-user costs with Venture Capital to gain market dominance, improve unit economics once enough market share is captured, and be patient until a liquidity event for the founders.

This isn’t a new strategy, nor a controversial one. Consumers benefited from Uber in their early days, where costs were so low for a ride that it made a cab, public transport, or even bothering a friend for a lift not worth it. DoorDash fees were low or non-existent early on that it always made sense to “dash” it. Costs are higher now - all good things come to an end.

Currently Cursor, v0, and all of the major LLM providers are dirt cheap. The ongoing costs of building and powering data centers, high salaries for AI engineers, and costs for training new models will rise. Eventually the investors will expect returns and the consumers will pick up the bill.

This strategy is sane if it weren’t for the lack of loyalty and the low switching costs.

Once the Cursor prices rise, another Cursor competitor will have fresh VC cash, and we’ll en-masse switch.

Copying the segment of Acquired, here are my bear and bull arguments for LLM tech for software engineering:

Bull

LLM providers go vertical, and provide not just the LLM, but the entirety of the coding tool stack.

OpenAI purchasing Windsurf makes perfect sense. Going vertical is the right move. Anthropic building Claude Code makes sense.

Bear

Developers already feel worn out and overwhelmed by the LLM wave. Developers with deep experience have found a lot of good uses for LLMs, but also we see the limitations.

Most of the hype train is conducted by less technical folks trying their hand at being an influencer, or by investors/founders with something to gain if their hot-takes are right. Ask the people with less to gain, and you’ll hear a much more subdued take on LLMs.
