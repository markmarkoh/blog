I'm the VP of Engineering at a small-but-mighty [construction tech startup](https://www.buildforce.com/), where I lead our Austin-based product & engineering capacity. 

This is my space to talk about projects, working at early stage startups, and computer programming in general. 

I occasionally publish episodes of [commithistory](https://commithistory.substack.com/), a show about significant commits in open source projects, and I'm often working on some low-stress side project which end up on my [github](https://github.com/markmarkoh).

See you around!
